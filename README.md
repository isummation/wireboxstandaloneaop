 Wirebox AOP Demo: How to use outside of ColdBox

The purpose of the this demo is to show other developers how to setup and use Wirebox outside of ColdBox. The ColdBox platform has many tools that can be used without a full install of the Coldbox framework. What is Wirebox? Wirebox is an enterprise level framework to bring dependency injection and AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming) to ColdFusion applications.

Wirebox will allow developers to regain control of their ColdFusion projects.As developers we are constantly challenged with those dreaded words: "We are going to need to make some changes." Well Wirebox will enable your software to be more sustainable and maintainable.

How you say? Wirebox taps into metadata annotations to make your object assembling, storage and creation easy.You will leverage the power of event driven object listeners so you can extend not only WireBox but the way objects are analyzed, created and wired.
